# Contrast

[Color contrast](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/2015-01-05-what-is-color-contrast/) is how legible colors are when placed next to,
and on top of each other. Adjacent colours should have sufficient contrast between them.

## Requirements

These are examples of the **minimum** requirements for contrast per element type.

**Note:** Interactive elements have been disabled and are meant for visual demonstration purposes only.
