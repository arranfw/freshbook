# Focus

Relevant WCAG Criteria:

- [Focus Visible](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-focus-visible.html) -
  Element focus is critically important to keyboard users. It's important to make sure keyboard and screen reader users can
  keep track of where they are on the page.
- [Focus Order](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-focus-order.html) -
  Elements should be ordered in a way that preserves meaning and operability, this usually means top to bottom and right to left.

## Success

There is nothing special happening here, the lesson here is that focus is handled very well by default.
When using simple designs and straight forward implementations you won't likely need to do anything to
manage focus manually.

The most notable feature here is the focus ring which, while being a very similar colour to the navbar,
has a white inner-border to make sure it has enough contrast even on the blue navbar.

  <Story name='Success'>{Success.bind({})}</Story>

## Failure

In the following example, each of the elements has a different focus state. This is something that happens
quite frequently as different people work on different pieces of a system. It's important to be as consistent
as possible with your focus states provide as smooth an experience as possible.

Check out the text field, its focus has been completely removed.
[This Google search (1700+ results!)](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Astackoverflow.com+remove+focus+ring&oq=site%3Astackoverflow.com+remove+focus+ring)
demonstrates how popular this technique is.

Long story short, if an element is focusable, it should be demonstrated in an obvious way.
If you remove the default outline, make sure to use appropriate alternative styling.

```
// Wrong
:focus {
  outline: 0;
}
// Right
:focus {
  outline: 0;
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 1px #fff, 0 0 0 3px #2e86de;
}
```

  <Story name='Failure'>{Failure.bind({})}</Story>
</Canvas>

## Pitfall

In this example, there's a visually hidden modal that takes focus and can confuse users as they try
to determine where focus is.

  <Story name='Pitfall'>{Pitfall.bind({})}</Story>
